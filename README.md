## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
This project approximately took 20 hour.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The way I conquered the problems, and they way KIVY gives GUI.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
There is nothing that leads to dissatisfaction.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The execution of the project was on fleek, and the kivy codes were very easy so did it flawlessly.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
there would be lot of learning before doing anything, so that I can code without getting reference from any site.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I used youtube to get through the basics of kivy and the examples that is given in the kivy documentation, I used them to get the syntax

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges were Kivy dependencies, they were all installed. but the project was throwing error that it cannot find window, it took lots of time, but then after reading and going through the discussions in stack overflow, and trying and experimenting, I reinstalled all the dependencies several time and then checked up with the path variable and then did some changes and installed the packages again and it worked.
